# IRIS_Flower_Analysis
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of the famous Iris flower dataset using Python. The Iris flower dataset is a famous and widely used dataset in machine learning and pattern recognition. It consists of measurements of four features : sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width,for three different species of Iris flowers : Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

Overview :- 

In this project, we explore the Iris flower dataset and perform various analyses to gain insights into the characteristics and relationships among the different species. The repository Jupyter notebook that walks through the entire analysis process, from data exploration and visualization to model building and evaluation.

Key Features:- 

1. Data Exploration: Understand the structure and properties of the dataset.

2. Data Visualization: Create informative visual representations of the dataset using popular Python libraries such as Matplotlib.

3. Model Building: Develop a machine learning model to classify Iris flower species. Implement a popular algorithm used in Machine Learning called Random Forest

4. Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the trained models using various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Employ techniques like cross-validation to obtain reliable performance estimates.
